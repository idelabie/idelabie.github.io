title: "Means to an End: How Affective Partisanship Informs Democratic Satisfaction in
Consensus Democracies"
abstract: "Extant work examines the institutional and electoral determinants of democratic satisfaction in multiparty contexts. However, scant attention has been devoted to examining how the nature of partisanship affects democratic satisfaction in such settings. To address this gap, I examine the relationship between affective polarization, the tendency to view opposing partisans negatively and co-partisan positively, and democratic satisfaction in consensus democracies. Specifically, I argue that highly affectively polarized partisans will be more invested in and satisfied with the functioning of democracy, perceiving such a regime as means by which to endow one's preferred political party with policy bargaining power in post-electoral environments. Using cross-sectional data from the available modules of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), I find convincing evidence that highly affectively polarized individuals are more likely to be satisfied with democracy than their less affectively polarized counterparts. These results have both empirical and theoretical implications for the scholarship on democratic satisfaction and the burgeoning scholarship on the attitudinal consequences of affective polarization in multiparty settings."
