<div style="text-align: justify;">

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh. My research primarily focuses on political behavior and political party strategy in Western Europe. In my dissertation, I examine how recent changes in an individual's local environment – whether induced by globalization, institutions or social movements – shape political grievances and inform political behavior across Western Europe. In my work, I leverage a combination of methods including spatial statistics, causal analysis and qualitative methods.
